Pig is a two-player game in which players alternate turns. On a player's turn, she chooses how many dice she'd like to roll (0-10). If she chooses 0, then her score for this turn is 1 more point than the largest digit in her opponent's score. If she chooses a number between 1 and 10, she rolls that many standard dice (each die has six-sides, numbered 1-6). If no 1s come up, her score for this turn is the total of the rolled dice; if any 1s come up, her score for this turn is 1. The player's score for this turn is added to her total score, and her opponent then gets a turn. Play continues until one of the players reaches a particular number of points, known as the "goal score". For example, if the goal score was 100, the player who reaches 100 or more points first wins!
